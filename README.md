# Angle Code

### A Spring Boot Java application.
* Using a MySQL database, with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.
* Made in IntelliJ IDEA.
* Spring Security is a work in progress.
    * Tried JWT, scraped it for session-based auth.
    * Spring Security helper classes are kinda confusing and can get mixed with your own custom ones.
* Has a simple yet nice UI design, using Thymeleaf, old Bootstrap version 3.*, HTML and CSS, and a bit of JQuery.
* Maven used as a build system.

This is definitely not finished. <b>It's used for practicing web development.</b>
More documentation will be written in sync with new additions to the project.
